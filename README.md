# reinforcement-learning-in-golang

Code freely created from ["Reinforcement Learning - An Introductiion (Second edition)"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition) book in Go.


### Motivation

After attacking [deep neural networks in Go](https://github.com/cyrildever/neural-networks-and-deep-learning-in-golang), I keep on investigating machine learning algorithms, this time with reinforcement learning. For that, Idecided to make my own adaptation of Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto's reference book on the subject.

The objective here was to transform the described algorithms found throughout the book in Go programming language. But, rest assured, I had no intention whatsoever to make it some kind of a reference. It was just simple practice. So don't see it for more than it is: I'm not claiming it's the best production way to implement each or any of these algorithms. But just a way to have fun while reading the book (I strongly advise you to read BTW).

_NB: I have mentioned the reference to the book boxes according to the second edition paging._
